# Crispen

Crispen is a Python code refactoring tool that performs a small, opinionated set of automated refactors to code diffs, providing a base level of code organization to any code change. It uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to detect issues and verify fixes, and a Large Language Model (LLM) to apply changes.
