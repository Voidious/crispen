    For module scope, inserts after the last import.
    For a named scope, inserts before the def/class line.

    If the named scope resolves to an indented ``def`` (i.e. a class method),
    inserting a module-level helper immediately before it would end the class
    definition prematurely — the remaining class methods would be silently
    re-parsed as nested functions of the helper, producing valid-syntax but
    broken code that ``compile()`` does not catch.  In that case we walk
    backwards to the enclosing class definition and insert before it instead.
