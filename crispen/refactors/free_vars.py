    """Return locally-scoped free variable names from block_src absent from the
    replacement.

    Free variables are names that are *read* (appear in a ``Load`` context) but
    not locally *assigned* (``Store``/``Del``) within the original block.  To
    avoid false positives from module-level names (imported symbols, globally-
    defined functions) that the extracted helper can reference directly, the
    check is restricted to names that appear as assignment targets or function
    parameters somewhere in *source* — these are variables that live in a local
    scope and cannot be reached by the helper without being threaded through as
    arguments.

    After this filtering, every remaining name must appear as a bare ``Name``
    node somewhere in the call-site replacements or the helper body.  A name
    that vanishes from both indicates the LLM silently changed the data flow —
    for example by turning a local variable reference into an attribute access
    on one of the parameters (``new_source`` → ``transformer.new_source``).

    Returns the set of names that are absent from both.  An empty set means the
    check passes.  Returns an empty set on any ``SyntaxError`` so a parse
    failure does not block the extraction — the later ``compile()`` guard will
    catch real syntax problems.
